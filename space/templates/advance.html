    <h1 id="heading">Exoplanet Study History: Advance Level:</h1>
    <p id="content">
        <div id="content1">
            The study of exoplanets revolutionized the knowledge about the universe-some complex and varied planetary systems, how life 
            can apparently exist well beyond Earth. The quest, along with its improvements in technologies and discoveries, has been one
            of the most important aspects of modern astrophysics.
            <h2>
                Key Detection Algorithms:
            </h2>
            <h5>The Radial Velocity Method:</h5> The method has been developed by astronomers in the 1990s, while looking for the Doppler effect of a star's light spectrum due to gravitational tugging from an orbiting planet. By monitoring the shifts in the star's spectrum, researchers can estimate the mass and orbital parameters of the planet. Indeed, this very method was used in finding 51 Pegasi b, the first exoplanet around a sun-like star.

            <h5>Transit Method:</h5> This is one method used by the Kepler Space Telescope to detect exoplanets. During a planet's passage 
            across the surface of its star, the brightness of the star is reduced in periodic manners. Such a technique has led to the 
            discovery of thousands of exoplanets, giving insight into their sizes, orbital periods, and possible habitability.

            The imaging is done through direct imaging of exoplanets by blocking the starlight that is twinkling along with them. 
            This makes it possible for researchers to study the atmospheres of distant planets for their composition and key molecules 
            such as water vapor and methane.
            Gravitational Microlensing: The method depends on the bending of light around enormous bodies; it will provide exoplanets 
            detection based on the usage of gravitational field in cases when a star with a planet passes in front of a farther star and
            amplifies its light due to gravitational field, indicating a planet by influences on the light curve.

           <h2>Major Discoveries:</h2>

           The past few decades have yielded significant discoveries, each of which has helped carve out our understanding of exoplanets.

            <h5>Gliese 581 System (2007):</h5> Gliese 581 c, an exoplanet within the habitable zone, was discovered, which raised hopes for 
            extraterrestrial life even further and showed that conditions for liquid water were actually possible.

            <h5>Kepler's Legacy (2012):</h5>The Kepler confirmation of more than 2,300 exoplanets finally cemented our new understanding of the 
            structure of the cosmos. It was showing the ubiquity of Earth-sized planets in habitable zones and thus suggesting that such
             worlds might be common across the galaxy.

            <h5>TRAPPIST-1 System, 2016:</h5> The discovery of seven Earth-sized planets doing transit with an ultra-cool dwarf star named TRAPPIST-1 was a 
            landmark finding. The system had three in the habitable zone and became really apropos concerning astrobiological interests.

            Contributions from South Africa The South African contribution thereby stands at the centre of the worldstage on exoplanet research.

            Southern African Large Telescope: one of the largest optical telescopes in the world, SALT can facilitate studies of nearby stars and
            contribute to exoplanet characterization by using high-resolution spectroscopy.

            Where the participation of South African astronomers in international collaborations, such as those on the ESO and the SKA project, 
            has gone further still in advancing the country's research capability and standing in astrophysics.

            <h5>Community Outreach:</h5> South African institutions reach out to the community through science education, in an effort to involve young 
            people in astronomy and foster the next generation of scientists. The Future Scene The prospects for the search for exoplanets continue 
            to get increasingly exciting. The missions themselves, more specifically, the James Webb Space Telescope and the Habitable Exoplanet 
            Observatory, JWST and HabEx for short, respectively, will attain unprecedented information about exoplanet atmospheres which could hint 
            toward biosignatures of life. With every passing day and each step in advanced technology, South Africa is in an excellent position to 
            make very worthy contributions regarding future discoveries in exoplanet research. As the nation takes active participation in international 
            collaboration and seeks to fire up the scientific spark in people, it certainly can be said that its contribution to this fast-evolving 
            field is not insignificant. Understanding exoplanets can also help us to further our insight into the universe and provide us with hope 
            that one day we may find life on other planets.
